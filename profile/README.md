## Warnings

Just a word of caution: Here be Dragons! And *you are* ***crunchy*** ... and taste good with ketchup.


## How do I get all the data?

We assume you can already get the XML/JSON/whatever you need... if you still have to ask, you're "not far enough," yet.

Your best clue is to find where the community "hangs out."
