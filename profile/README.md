# Gems of War Enthusiasts 👋

This is a place for "enthusiasts" to potentially contribute public code.

We assume you can already get the XML you need... if you have to ask, you're "not far enough," yet.

## How do I get the XML?

Your only clue is to find where the community "hangs out."

## Warnings

Just a word of caution... here be dragon! And, *you are* ***crunchy***, and taste good with ketchup.
